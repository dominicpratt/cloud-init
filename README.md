# Cloud-Init Script and Configuration Files

This repository contains a Cloud-Init script along with the associated configuration files `.bashrc` and `.vimrc`, which are used to customize the server environment to my needs.

## Contents

-  **cloud-init.yaml**: The Cloud-Init script that runs when a new server is initialized. It updates the packages, creates the `.vimrc` file, and replaces the `.bashrc` file with custom settings.
-  **bashrc**: The configuration file for the Bash shell, containing customizations for the prompt, history, and auto-completion.
-  **vimrc**: The configuration file for the Vim text editor, setting basic options such as syntax highlighting and color scheme.
